	<h2> How Scrip Fundraising works </h2>
	<ol>
		<li> When families order scrip they pay full face value for gift cards </li>
		<li> If someone orders $100 gift card for the local grocery store the Scrip Club receives a 2%-13% discount depending on retailer </li>
		<li> The % discount is then awarded to the Scrib Club as a rebate </li>

# This website has good flow and structure. A big banner on the top with text overlaying an # image. It is followed up with a number of discrete sections following logical user        # experience of trying to learn more. When inspecting the different parts of the webpage    # I'm amazing by the amount of <div> tags used. Almost every line has its own <div> tag.
