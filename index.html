	<p> Top Benefits of Scrip Fundraising </p>
	<ul> 
		<li> No asking families to sell unwanted or unnecessary products to family and firends </li>
		<li> It's easy for a single shcool family to generate $600 - $1,000 a year or more </li>
		<li> Everyday family purchases become consistent earnings for your organization</li>
		<li> Scrip earnings (3%-15%) are greater than credit card rewards </li>
	</ul>

	<p> How Scrip Fundraising works </p>
	<ol>
		<li> When families order scrip they pay full face value for gift cards </li>
		<li> If someone orders $100 gift card for the local grocery store the Scrip Club receives a 2%-13% discount depending on retailer </li>
		<li> The % discount is then awarded to the Scrib Club as a rebate </li>
